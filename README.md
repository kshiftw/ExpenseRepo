Prior to this project, I covered the basics of Java by following the online CS106A course provided by Stanford: https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A

## Step-by-step summary
1. Defined goal of the application: "To create an application that allows users to track expenses and easily visualize what categories their expenses fall into.". My method of approach was to learn as I came across things I needed.
2. Read through the various tutorials provided by Tutorialspoint that I needed before starting my application:
	* Java Servlets: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/servlets/index.htm	
	* Java Database Connectivity (JDBC): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jdbc/index.htm
